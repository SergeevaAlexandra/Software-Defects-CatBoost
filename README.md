# Software-Defects-CatBoost
Binary Classification with a Software Defects Dataset

The challenge in this competition revolves around binary classification for detecting software defects using synthetic dataset
that was generated froma deep learning model trained on the Software Defect Dataset.
The performance metric employed to assess the models is the area under the ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve).
